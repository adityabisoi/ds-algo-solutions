## ds-algo-solutions

A collection of solutions for Hackerrank data structures and algorithm problems in Python, JAVA, and CPP. This community-owned project aims to bring together the solutions for the ds & Algo problems across various platforms, along with the resources for learning them. Problems from Leetcode will be included soon in the project.

#### Contribution Guidelines
Go to the Hackerrank problem-solving section (https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures), solve a problem such that it passes all test cases, make a Pull Request with the solution in the respective folder. Feel free to suggest any useful resources for studying ds & algo.e 

Also, please explain your code with comments.
